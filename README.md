# Stournal
This is the app project I came with from the word "Study Journal"

In idea, making this to work I need to put this git on public and create the backbone for this.
But it need the micro components to be created and the integrate in the system. Later on I will proceed in creating the application.

Why Am I putting an idea here. Is it because I need to make an open alternative for the students, professors and observers to have a journal app for their studies. Also creating this is also helping our side to easily create a program algo to the codes we need to develop. I really don't know the I idea what came up to my mind but this is kind of helpful for me to understand the career I took.

For now, I will create a logical diagram for the project. Later I will posted it inside this application.

## Here is the Road Map:
### Need to integrate services/micro-components of the following like:

1. Note
2. Calculator (all kind)
3. Graph creation
4. Simulator (that will based on the observation instruction)
5. Report Generation

### Extras:
AI for documentation making

### Extensions:
1. AI of specific study
2. Google Scholar Web Integration ? sort of
3. Internet Archives (for library)

I can't really do much because of the work. but I will do my best.
